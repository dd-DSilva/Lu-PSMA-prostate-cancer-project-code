# Lu-PSMA-prostate-cancer-project-code
This repository is portfolio of code I wrote during a research project I undertook during my Master of Genome Analytics course in 2025.
I undertook this project at the Clinical Genomics and Bioinformatics Group at the Monash University School of Translational Medicine.

The aim of the project was to curate genetic variants in cancer-associated genes in a cohort of patients with late-stage prostate cancer who were placed on Lu-PSMA treatment, and use statistical techniques to identify variants that may be predictors of treatment response. I performed variant curation (against the ACMG guidelines) manually in an Excel sheet, and this data along with patient clinical data were used as inputs by the code in this repository to perform multiple statistical analyses and generate plots. I additionally calculated ctDNA fraction for each patient and analysed that, and identified newly-arisen major clones across time.

I realise looking back on this code that is is messy and disorganised. I learned how to write better code as I went, and I'm still improving.
